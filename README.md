# Optimization-Method

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `optimization_methods.ipynb` that demonstrates the implementation of two optimization methods to find the global minimum of the Michalewicz function. The two optimization methods used in this notebook are Gradient-based Optimization and Nelder-Mead Optimization.

### Optimization Introduction

Optimization is a fundamental problem in mathematics and computer science, and it has various real-world applications. We explore two optimization methods to find the global minimum of the Michalewicz function. The Michalewicz function is a commonly used benchmark problem for testing optimization algorithms. By implementing and comparing two different optimization methods, we aim to provide insights into how different techniques can be used to find the global minimum of a function.

### Michalewicz function

The Michalewicz function is a mathematical function commonly used in optimization problems to test and benchmark optimization algorithms. It was introduced by the Polish mathematician Zbigniew Michalewicz. The function is defined as a multi-dimensional, highly non-linear, and non-convex function. It is often used to assess the performance of optimization techniques due to its challenging landscape with many local minima and steep variations.

### Gradient-based Optimization

Gradient-based optimization is a technique that uses the gradient of the function to iteratively update the solution. In the notebook, we will implement gradient descent to find the global minimum of the Michalewicz function.

### Nelder-Mead Optimization

The Nelder-Mead optimization method, also known as the downhill simplex method, is a derivative-free optimization technique. It uses a simplex, which is a geometric figure formed by the function's evaluations, to iteratively explore the parameter space. In the notebook, we will implement the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm to find the global minimum of the Michalewicz function.
